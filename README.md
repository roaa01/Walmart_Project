# Walmart_Project
Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (Copy_of_Walmart_Bi_Project.ipynb) is designed for analyzing sales data from Walmart. The project leverages machine learning techniques to explore, preprocess, and model the data, aiming to derive insights and predict key business metrics such as sales or profit.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains detailed transaction records from Walmart, including information such as:

Order Details: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
Customer Information: Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment
Geographical Data: Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region
Product Information: Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
Sales Metrics: Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit

A sample of the dataset is displayed in the notebook, showing the first five rows with 21 columns.
Notebook Structure
The notebook is organized into the following key sections:

Import Libraries:

Libraries used include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
Machine learning libraries: sklearn (for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation), xgboost for advanced modeling.
Specific tools: OneHotEncoder, MinMaxScaler, ColumnTransformer, Pipeline, Ridge, RandomForestRegressor, StackingRegressor, XGBRegressor.
Evaluation metrics: mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score, accuracy_score.


Data Reading:

The dataset is loaded and displayed to provide an initial understanding of its structure and contents.



Prerequisites
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python packages:pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost



Usage

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>


Open the Notebook:Launch Jupyter Notebook and open Copy_of_Walmart_Bi_Project.ipynb:
jupyter notebook


Run the Cells:

Execute the cells sequentially to load libraries, read the dataset, and perform subsequent analyses.
Ensure the dataset file is accessible in the same directory or update the file path in the data reading section.



Notes

The notebook is configured to run on a system with a GPU (as indicated by the Colab metadata with T4 GPU).
Ensure sufficient computational resources for machine learning tasks, especially when training models like RandomForestRegressor or XGBRegressor.
The dataset preview suggests a focus on sales and profit prediction, so further cells (not shown in the provided snippet) likely include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Future Enhancements

Add data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values or outliers.
Include exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends, such as sales by region or category.
Expand model evaluation with additional metrics or cross-validation techniques.
Document specific business insights derived from the analysis.
